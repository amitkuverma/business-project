            PLATFORM</label>
        <div class="" style="text-align: center;">
            <p class="text">
                Access to and use of the Platform is available only to individuals who are at least 18 years old and
                can form legally binding contracts under applicable law.
                By accessing or using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you are eligible.<br><br>

                By registering or using the Platform to offer, post, or provide Pro Services, Service Members
                represent
                and warrant that they, and the employees, agents, contractors, and subcontractors who may perform
                work for them,
                are properly and fully qualified and experienced, and licensed, certified, bonded, and insured, as
                required by
                applicable laws or regulations to which they may be subject in the jurisdiction(s) in which they
                offer their Pro
                Services and in relation to the specific job they are performing. Service Members otherwise agree to
                comply with all
                applicable laws, including the
                Consumer Privacy Act, in their use of the Platform and any personal information obtained from the
                Platform.<br><br>
                Task&Earn is not in the business of providing Pro Services. Service Members understand and agree
                that by creating and maintaining an account on the Platform, they receive only the ability to use
                the Task&Earn Platform to access persons interested in receiving Pro Services and related tools,
                including but not limited to the ability to message those persons or schedule appointments, that
                facilitate the provision of Pro Services. For example, Customer Members may use the Platform to
                intentionally interact with Service Members regarding Pro Services. Service Members understand and
                agree that using the Platform does not guarantee that anyone will engage them for Pro
                Services.<br><br>

                Service Members understand and agree that they are customers of Task&Earn, and are not Task&Earn
                employees, joint venturers, partners, or agents. Service Members acknowledge that they set or
                confirm their own prices, provide their own equipment, and determine their own work schedule.
                Task&Earn does not control, and has no right to control, the services a Service Member provides
                (including how the Service Member provides such services) if the Service Member is engaged by a
                Customer Member or any other person, except as specifically noted herein.<br>
